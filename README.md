## Overview

AICONSTRUCT-PM is a web application designed to automate the tedious process of analyzing daily construction reports. This tool leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to read unstructured text documents (`.txt` files) and extract key, actionable data, presenting it in a clean, structured JSON format. It's built for project managers, site engineers, and cost controllers who need to quickly process information without spending hours on manual data entry.

This project serves as a "proof-of-concept" to solve a real-world business problem I witnessed firsthand in the construction industry: the bottleneck caused by manual document processing.

## How It Works: Before & After

The application transforms a standard, hard-to-parse daily report into a structured, easy-to-use data object.

### **BEFORE:** Unstructured Daily Report

A typical daily report is a simple text file, rich with information but difficult to process automatically.

### **AFTER:** AI-Extracted Structured Data

The application extracts the vital information and organizes it into a clean JSON format, ready for use in other systems like databases or dashboards.

## Key Features

- **File Upload:** Simple and intuitive interface to upload `.txt` construction reports.
- **AI-Powered Extraction:** Uses a Large Language Model to intelligently parse the document and identify key data points.
- **Structured Output:** Presents the extracted data in a clean, developer-friendly JSON format.
- **Web-Based & Accessible:** Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible from anywhere without any local installation.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python
- **AI/ML:** Hugging Face Inference API (simulated)
- **Web Framework/UI:** Gradio
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
