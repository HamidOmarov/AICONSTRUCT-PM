AICONSTRUCT-PM: AI-Powered Construction Project Assistant üèóÔ∏è
Live Demo: üöÄ AICONSTRUCT-PM on Hugging Face Spaces
(Note: The live demo is currently running in an offline simulation mode due to an external network issue with the Inference API, but it fully demonstrates the application's functionality.)

Overview
AICONSTRUCT-PM is a web application designed to automate the tedious process of analyzing daily construction reports. This tool leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to read unstructured text documents (.txt files) and extract key, actionable data, presenting it in a clean, structured JSON format. It's built for project managers, site engineers, and cost controllers who need to quickly process information without spending hours on manual data entry.

This project serves as a "proof-of-concept" to solve a real-world business problem I witnessed firsthand in the construction industry: the bottleneck caused by manual document processing.

How It Works: Before & After
The application transforms a standard, hard-to-parse daily report into a structured, easy-to-use data object.

BEFORE: Unstructured Daily Report
A typical daily report is a simple text file, rich with information but difficult to process automatically.

AFTER: AI-Extracted Structured Data
The application extracts the vital information and organizes it into a clean JSON format, ready for use in other systems like databases or dashboards.

Key Features
File Upload: Simple and intuitive interface to upload .txt construction reports.

AI-Powered Extraction: Uses a Large Language Model to intelligently parse the document and identify key data points.

Structured Output: Presents the extracted data in a clean, developer-friendly JSON format.

Web-Based & Accessible: Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible from anywhere without any local installation.
